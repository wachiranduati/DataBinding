## DATABINDING
Data binding playground

## Intro
Databinding library is a support library that allows you to bind your UI with your data sources using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

The magic that comes about from this is taking code from this
```findViewById<TextView>(R.id.sample_text).apply {
     text = viewModel.userName
 }```

 ## TO

 ```<TextView
      android:text="@{viewmodel.userName}" />
      ```
right in your xml code

## To get Started
include the following declaration in your build.gradle file to enable databinding on your project

```android {
     ...
     buildFeatures {
         dataBinding true
     }
 }
 ```
